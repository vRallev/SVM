Android SVM
============

This is a project for a course from Professor Joachim Giesen I attended at the Friedrich Schiller University Jena. The goal is to write a support vector machine for Android. 

**Important:** This project uses Android's old build system. If you want to test the compiled project, install the [attached .apk file](SVM.apk).

This project depends on following libraries:
- https://github.com/greenrobot/EventBus
- https://github.com/ManuelPeinado/RefreshActionItem-Native
