Android SVM
============

This was a project for a course from Professor Joachim Giesen at the Friedrich Schiller University Jena. The task was to write a support vector machine. I've chosen Android as platform. 

**Important:** This project uses Android's old build system. If you want to test the compiled project, install the [attached .apk file](SVM.apk).

This project depends on following libraries:
